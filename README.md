Overview: Generate Simulated Data: We will create a synthetic dataset of distance measurements versus redshift.
Define a Model: We'll define a simple linear model to relate distance and redshift, which is appropriate for cosmological distances.
MCMC Sampling: Use the MCMC method to sample from the posterior distribution of the Hubble constant.
Plotting: Visualize the results to show how the Hubble speed changes with redshift.


Libraries Needed: You will need the following Python libraries:

NumPy for numerical operations.
Matplotlib for plotting.
SciPy for scientific computations.
emcee, a Python library for MCMC.

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy emcee
